# Event-Trading-Strategy
Event trading strategy based on multimodal financial sentiment analysis of the S&P 100. In my PhD I built a multimodal sentiment classifier for earnings conference calls of companies in the S&P 100. This project uses that model to classify ~5,000 earnings calls based on their text and audio modalities and creates a trading strategy to sell, buy or hold securities based on the sentiment of their most recent earnings call. The project extends by backtesting the results and then creating a user interface that allows participants to select companies in my sample, select sentiment thresholds (i.e., if call sentiment > X, buy and if sentiment < y sell) and view the results of their selection. The strategy implements a 0.01% trading cost in attempts to provide a more realistic outcome.
